# Portfolio

This is a template for a portfolio website.
So far the site is static, built with HTML and CSS files.

## A word of caution

I'm learning the fundamentals of writing CSS,
so you will notice I'm not using [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) yet.
It's good to learn floats and positioning first.

Also, the site is responsive.


Stay tuned, as I hopefully learn to write better CSS!
